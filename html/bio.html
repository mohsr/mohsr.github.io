		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<h3>Hi, I'm Mohsin</h3>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm Mohsin. I'm a student at Tufts University in Medford, 
			Massachussetts, and I'm studying Computer Science and Cognitive 
			and Brain Science. I'm from a small town in South Carolina, and 
			I have two siblings (one older and one younger).
		</p>

		<h3>What I Like To Do</h3>
		<p>
			I like to tinker with the command line, research new languages 
			and technologies, and build games. 
			<a href=http://store.steampowered.com/app/705370/The_Cursed_Tower>
			Here</a> you can see a game I built on my own and 
			<a href="https://redorbluegame.wixsite.com/redorblue">here</a> 
			you can see one I built with a team!
		</p>

		<h3>What Else I Like To Do</h3>
		<p>
			I love playing video games with my friends. The following list is 
			a mixture of some of my favorite games and some of the games I'm 
			playing a lot of right now (in no particular order):
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>World of Warcraft</li>
			<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</li>
			<li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</li>
			<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
			<li>Fortnite</li>
			<li>Shadow of the Colossus</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Additionally, I love building jigsaw puzzles with my family 
			whenever I'm home. I also like playing board games and tabletop 
			games. So, here's a list of some cool board games I like 
			(again, in no particular order):
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dungeons and Dragons 5E</li>
			<li>Codenames</li>
			<li>Bananagrams</li>
			<li>Betrayal at House on the Hill</li>
		</ul>
