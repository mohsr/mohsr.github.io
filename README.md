## A. Overview

Currently, this is my personal homepage, just for holding links and resources
that I visit often. You can visit it [here](https://mohsr.github.io).

Formerly, this repository held my homepage that I made for my web programming
course at Tufts. You can still find that page in the history of this repository.
